# Data Visualization

Data visualization project aims to construct a framework for rapid construction of web-based visualization.

The png file in this folder shows the structure of frame. I was involved in the whole process of the project. Except for some charts I drew (like circos, chord, synteny, bar, etc.), I optimized the algorithm of data updates which is faster and less error-prone. In addition, I managed to draw 4 million dots on a web page which usually holds 0.2 million dots after trying four different algorithms.

The folders in this folder are some of the charts I drew.
