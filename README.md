These are parts of the scripts that I wrote at my first work.

Due to the company's confidentiality policy, I can just show part of the scripts to demonstrate my programming skills.

I was mainly involved in two projects: WGS analysis and Data visualization.

WSG analysis is mainly done by using Python, R and Perl and Data visualization is written in JavaScript and D3.
