# WGS Analysis

SangerBiocluster is a framework which can be used to construct pipelines for bioinformatics analysis. 

The figure below shows the structure of SangerBiocluster.

In this framework, different parts of the pipelines are modularized. Most scripts related to bioinformatics analysis are in the mbio folder. For example, the file folder is the file check module, the workflows folder contains the piplines for different analysis(including DNA, RNA, Protein), the tools folder contains scripts that are the minimum element of calculation.

I was involved in four DNA analysis projects and more than 10 Tools like primer design, linear regression and so on. The four folders in the WGS_Analysis folder list some Python, Perl and R scripts I wrote.
